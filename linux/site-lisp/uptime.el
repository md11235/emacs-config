;;; uptime.el by David N. Welton <davidw@dedasys.com>

;;; uptime defines 2 user visible functions, `uptime' and
;;; `linux-uptime'. `uptime' works on all systems, but must be
;;; initiliazed with `uptime-init' in your .emacs file.
;;; `linux-uptime' is, as the name suggests, specific to GNU/Linux
;;; systems because of its dependence on the /proc filesystem.
