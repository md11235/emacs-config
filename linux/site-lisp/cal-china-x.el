;;; Commentary:

;; This package adds more chinese calendar supports. Currently, it can
;; show lunar calendar, horoscope info, zodiac info, etc. Feedbacks are
;; warmly welcome.

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your
;; ~/.emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'cal-china-x)

;;; History

;; This is a derived work from `chinese-calendar.el' written by Charles
;; Wang <charleswang@peoplemail.com.cn>.

;;; TODO:

;; - Display week day(the first line of each month) in chinese properly
;; - hemi-seasons stuffs, 24 in total
;; - possible bug in `holiday-chinese', since it doesn't know 2006.08.30
;;   is another Qi Xi festival
;; - Fix diary display bug. Now it shows "期日". We need to figure out a
;;   way to let Emacs calendar understand chinese `dayname'.
